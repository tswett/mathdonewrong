Welcome to mathdonewrong's documentation!
=========================================

This is "mathdonewrong," a somewhat silly attempt at doing formalized
mathematics in Python. You may be thinking that Python is not the right language
for doing formalized mathematics inâ€”and that's the reason for the name.

(sorry, I don't know how Sphinx works so this documentation looks pretty messed
up at the moment)
