Math done wrong!
================

This is "mathdonewrong," a somewhat silly attempt at doing formalized
mathematics in Python. You may be thinking that Python is not the right language
for doing formalized mathematics inâ€”and that's the reason for the name.

The two fundamental classes are :class:`~mathdonewrong.expressions.Expression`
and :class:`~mathdonewrong.algebras.Algebra`.

An ``Expression`` is an expression tree, consisting of operators, literals, and
variables. Generally speaking, an expression, by itself, is meaningless. An
``Algebra`` is an object that provides meanings for expressions by implementing
their operators.

There are many subclasses of ``Algebra`` corresponding to various varieties and
instances of mathematical structures. For example,
:class:`~mathdonewrong.monoids.monoids.Monoid` is a subclass of ``Algebra`` which
describes the concept of a monoid (but doesn't provide any implementations), and
:class:`~mathdonewrong.monoids.monoids.IntAddition` and
:class:`~mathdonewrong.monoids.monoids.IntMultiplication` are subclasses of ``Monoid``
which actually represent particular monoids, and provide the appropriate
implementations.

There are a few modules which attempt to implement various particular kinds of
mathematical structures. In no particular order, some of these are:

- The :mod:`~mathdonewrong.monoids` module describes monoids and implements a
  few examples. It also contains an initial attempt at defining what a
  homomorphism is.
- The :mod:`~mathdonewrong.boolean_algebra` module describes Boolean algebras
  and provides an implementation of the standard Boolean algebra.
- The :mod:`~mathdonewrong.categories` and
  :mod:`~mathdonewrong.monoidal_categories` modules are an early-feeling attempt
  at defining categories.
- The :mod:`~mathdonewrong.lambda_calc` and
  :mod:`~mathdonewrong.primitive_recursive` modules define a couple of models of
  computation.

(sorry, I don't know how Sphinx works so this documentation looks pretty messed
up at the moment)
