This is "mathdonewrong," a somewhat silly attempt at doing formalized
mathematics in Python.

The name of the project alludes to the fact that everything is done in a very
loose manner: there's no static typechecking and no overarching theory.

This is a Poetry project, so you can install the dependencies and run the tests
in the usual way:

    poetry install
    poetry run pytest
